The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or plural.\nDefinitions For this Privacy Policy:\n Account means a unique account created for You to access our Service or parts of our Service. Company (referred to as either “the Company,” “We,” “Us,” or “Our” in this Agreement) refers to My Personal Website. Cookies are small files placed on Your computer, mobile device, or any other device by a website, containing the details of Your browsing history on that Website among its many uses.

Personal Data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. Service refers to the Website.

It refers to third-party companies or individuals employed by the Company to facilitate the Service, provide the Service on behalf of the Company, perform services related to the Service, or assist the Company in analyzing how the Service is used. Usage Data refers to data collected automatically, either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit). Website refers to this, My Personal Website, accessible from https://nighttime.coffee, https://moonlit.coffee or applicable web properties. You means the individual accessing or using the Service, or the Company, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Service, as applicable.  Collecting and Using Your Personal Data Types of Data Collected   Personal Data While using Our Service, We may ask You to provide Us with certain personally identifiable information that can contact or identify You. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:\n  Usage Data\n  Usage Data Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service.\nUsage Data may include information such as Your Device’s Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that You visit, the time and date of Your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.\nWhen You access the Service by or through a mobile device, We may collect certain information automatically. This information includes, but is not limited to, the type of mobile device You use, Your mobile device’s unique ID, the IP address of Your mobile device, Your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser You use, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.\nWe may also collect information that Your browser sends whenever You visit our Service or when You access the Service by or through a mobile device.\nTracking Technologies and Cookies (We don’t use any of these but here is information about them and additional privacy information and how to remove them.)\nTrust, but verify. You can confirm that no tracking technologies are used by looking at “Storage” in the Web Developer tools. Additionally, only one tiny script is run, and that is to update the year in the footer.\nCookies Cookies and similar tracking technologies are used to track the activity on Our Service and store certain information. Tracking technologies used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and improve and analyze Our Service. The technologies We use may include:\n Cookies or Browser Cookies. A cookie is a small file placed on Your Device. You can instruct Your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a cookie is sent. However, if You do not accept Cookies, You may not be able to use some parts of our Service. Unless you have adjusted Your browser setting to refuse cookies, our Service may use Cookies.  Cookies can be “Persistent” or “Session” Cookies. Persistent Cookies remain on Your personal computer or mobile device when You go offline, while Session Cookies are deleted as soon as You close Your web browser.\nSupercookies  Flash Cookies. Certain features of our Service may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about Your preferences or Your activity on our Service. Flash Cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as those used for Browser Cookies. Local Shared Objects. These are similar to Flask Cookies; there are four separate areas in the browser to store persistent data Cookies, Flash Objects or Flash Cookies (see above), the browser cache (see below), and LSO’s (Locally Shared Objects) that are typically in the form of SQLite Databases or other persistent in-browser storage locations. Another is a UIDH or Unique IDentifier Header that is added inline to your query by your ISP. We don’t read your UIDH or use any persistent storage.  Beacons  Web Beacons. Certain sections of our Service and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons, also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs. This beacon permits the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of a particular section and verifying system and server integrity).  (We use none of the methods above;) if we did, it would be for the purposes set out below:\n  Necessary / Essential Cookies\nType: Session Cookies\nAdministered by: Us\nPurpose: These cookies are essential to provide You with services available through the Website and enable You to use some of its features. They help to authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts.

The purpose of these cookies is to provide You with a more personal experience and avoid You having to re-enter your preferences every time You use the Website.\n  Analytics   Google Analytics. You also load our analytics package that uses JavaScript to provide aggregated information in Google Analytics by loading our Website. It’s common to find this on a website, but we believe you’re more critical than a real-time spreadsheet.\n  Cloudflare. Instead of loading the Website through third parties we have relationships with, we gave our DNS services to CloudFlare, and every time you load our Website, you’re pulling it from the Cloudflare global CDN. We use KeyCDN and BunnyCDN. BunnyCDN is our primary and is very privacy positive.
