# HomeNet

The HomeNet for many is in need of evolution as our networks could easily become
a part of the Operational Area if our employer is targetted. What we advocate 
for as a part of our jobs we should practice at $HOME. This is the foundation of
the HomeNet, a high availability low downtime tolerance experimental network.
